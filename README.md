# **Agohya OS**

**Open. Elegant. Yours.**

Agohya is an ambitious open-source operating system designed to provide the flexibility of Linux, the elegance of macOS, and a user-first experience for both everyday users and developers. It will be lightweight, highly secure, and performant, all while maintaining a minimalist design ethos.

This project is currently in the planning stages, with early development focused on establishing the core kernel and basic system architecture. The ultimate goal is to create an OS that integrates seamlessly across devices (laptops, phones, tablets) while offering a customizable development platform for developers to create apps and experiences.

---

## **Vision**

- **Minimalist and Modern**: Clean, simple, and efficient design for both users and developers.
- **Performance and Security**: A lightweight kernel and system focused on speed, security, and minimal overhead.
- **Seamless Interconnectivity**: Designed to work flawlessly across devices, providing a cohesive experience between desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
- **Open-Source and Extensible**: Encouraging open-source contributions while making sure the project grows as an accessible and flexible platform for all.

---

## **Project Status**

The project is still in its **early stages**, and the current focus is on:

- Designing the **core kernel**.
- Planning the **user-space SDK**.
- Determining the architecture and **license model**.
- Finalizing the **contribution and community guidelines**.

---

## **Goals for the Future**

1. **Kernel Development**:
   - Build a highly efficient kernel that will serve as the foundation of Agohya. We're considering using **Zig** for the kernel due to its simplicity and performance.

2. **User Space SDK**:
   - Develop an easy-to-use SDK for building applications using **Vlang**, focusing on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of integration with the Agohya OS.
   
3. **Cross-Device Support**:
   - Ensure seamless interconnectivity between various devices (laptops, phones, tablets).

4. **Security**:
   - Implement modern security features and privacy-focused functionality, drawing inspiration from both Linux and Apple systems.

## **Getting Involved**

Agohya is open-source and we encourage contributions from the community. If you want to help with the project, here are some things you can do:

- **Contribute Code**: Help develop the kernel, user-space SDK, or other parts of the project.
- **Suggest Features**: Provide feedback on the design and features you’d like to see in Agohya.
- **Report Issues**: Let us know about bugs or things you think need improvement.

---

## **Roadmap**

Here’s the basic roadmap for the development of Agohya OS:

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Architecture**
   - Establish the high-level architecture and choose core technologies (kernel, SDK, etc.).
   - Set up initial project structure and repository.

2. **Phase 2: Kernel and Bootloader**
   - Begin development of the kernel using **Zig**.
   - Set up bootloader and basic system startup functionality.

3. **Phase 3: User Space SDK and Application Framework**
   - Begin work on the SDK using **Vlang** for developing applications.
   - Set up essential libraries and tools for developers.

4. **Phase 4: Cross-Platform Features and Interconnectivity**
   - Begin working on seamless interconnectivity between different device types (laptops, phones, etc.).
