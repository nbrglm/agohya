## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org) to ensure that all contributions are properly signed off.  
By submitting a patch, you agree to the DCO.

### Signing off your commits

To sign off your commits, use the `-s` flag in your Git commit command:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will append a Signed-off-by line to your commit message, which looks like:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Commits without a proper sign-off will not be accepted.

## Guidelines
- Ensure your changes are clear, well-documented, and tested.

- Follow the coding standards and formatting rules of the project.

- For large features or breaking changes, open an issue or proposal first.

- Keep PRs focused and small; large PRs take longer to review.

## Project Setup

- Coming Soon
